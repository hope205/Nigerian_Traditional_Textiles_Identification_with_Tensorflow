# Nigerian Traditional Textiles Identification with TensorFlow



This project aims to identify Nigerian traditional textiles using a deep convolutional neural network model. The model has achieved an accuracy of approximately 85% and has been integrated into an Android app. The app not only predicts the names of traditional textiles from their images but also provides suggestions for various attires that can be sewn using the predicted textile.

Here is a demo video that shows how it works

## Features

    - Image classification: The deep convolutional neural network model can accurately classify Nigerian traditional textiles from images.
    - Attire suggestions: The app provides suggestions for different attires that can be created using the predicted textile.
    - Android integration: The model has been integrated into an Android app using Flutter and Android Studio.
    - TensorFlow: The model was built using TensorFlow, a popular deep learning framework.
    
## Usage

Once the app is installed on your Android device or emulator, follow these steps to identify traditional textiles:

1. Launch the app on your device.

2. Capture or select an image of a Nigerian traditional textile.

3. The app will process the image and display the predicted name of the textile.

4. Scroll down to view suggestions for different attires that can be created using the predicted textile.

5. Explore the app to identify more textiles and discover attire suggestions.
